General Process
    User adds information into an HTML structured form. Their HTML code will require a submit button
    to be hit. This submit button in HTML will have an action along with it. We will need to research 
    the possible actions, meaning how we can get the info from that form into our method.
    Our method will take that data and push it to the database. We will use MySQL queries to grab
    specific info from the database and display it to the dynamic web page.
    
    Things to think about
        Submit button actions
